# Hello World Lab

## Prerequisites
- You are expected to review the `Entities of Java` written lecture prior to working on this lab. If you are not familiar with the concepts being explored in the lab, please make sure to review the study material first.

## Description
In this exercise, you will practice working with methods and returning a value from a method.

## Completing the Lab
You will be editing the file `Greeting.java`. This file can be found under the `src/main/java` package. Review the file's code and code comments for further instructions.

Tasks to complete within the `Greeting.java` file:
- [ ] Revise the return statement of the method named `sayHello`

## Running Tests and Committing
The `src/test/java` folder will contain your test files. To run the tests, click on the Testing tab (test beaker icon on the left-hand side) and run the test cases by using the "Run Test" button (play icon). Please ensure that you do not already have the program running. 

After running the tests, if all the test cases pass, you can commit your work using the Version Control tab. In the Version Control tab, enter a commit message, and then press the Commit button. If asked to stage your changes, please do so. Lastly, wait until the `history_log.txt` file appears before navigating back to RevaturePro.

You can optionally run the program for manual testing by switching to the file named `Main.java` under the `src/main/java` package and clicking the "Run Java" button (play icon) on the top-right of VSCode. Please be aware that manual testing does not affect the completion of your lab. To ensure your lab is complete, you are required to run and pass the tests in the Testing tab.
